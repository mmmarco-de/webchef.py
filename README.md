## 🚀 Getting Started: Setting Up Your Kitchen

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these ingredients before you start cooking:

- **Python 3.6+:** `webchef.py` runs on modern Python.
  - Check your version: `python3 --version`
  - Download Python: <https://www.python.org/downloads/> (Remember to add Python to your PATH during installation!)

### Installation

1.  **Download `webchef.py`:**
    Grab the `webchef.py` file from this repository. You can clone the repo or simply download the file directly.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/webchef.py.git](https://github.com/your-username/webchef.py.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd webchef.py
    ```

    Or, if you just have the code, simply save it into a file named `webchef.py`.

2.  **No extra `pip` installs needed for `webchef.py` itself!** It uses only standard Python libraries.

## 👨‍🍳 How to Use webchef.py

It's as easy as pie!

1.  **Go to Your Serving Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder you want to serve. This is your "kitchen" for `webchef.py`.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/awesome/project
    ```

2.  **Start the Server:**
    Run the `webchef.py` script:

    ```bash
    python3 webchef.py
    ```

    (If `python3` doesn't work, try `python webchef.py`).

    You'll see a friendly message like:

    ```
    ✨ webchef.py is cooking! Serving on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
    🏡 Your kitchen (root directory): /path/to/your/awesome/project
    ```

3.  **Visit Your Web Page:**
    Open your favorite web browser and go to the address shown in the terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).
    - If you have an `index.html` in that folder, `webchef.py` will serve it.
    - If not, it will automatically generate a lovely dark-themed index page listing all files and subfolders!

### 📄 Automatic Index Pages (The Recipe Book Feature!)

`webchef.py` is smart! If you navigate to a directory (like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/my_subfolder/`) and there's no `index.html` inside, `webchef.py` will temporarily create one for you. This page will list all the files and subdirectories within that specific folder, making navigation a breeze.

**Important:** These auto-generated `index.html` files are temporary! They are automatically **deleted** when you stop the `webchef.py` server. Your original files remain untouched.

### 🛑 Stopping the Server (Closing the Kitchen)

To stop `webchef.py`, simply go back to the terminal where it's running and press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on macOS).

You'll then receive your **webchef.py Receipt**, detailing how long your server was running and how many dishes (requests) it served!
