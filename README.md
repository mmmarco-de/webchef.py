## About the Kitchen

There are some simple web servers out there, like basic kitchen appliances, just for tasting your website creations with HTML and CSS. But I felt they weren't as user-friendly as this recipe. So, I've refined it and experimented.

Of course, this isn't the finest dining experience yet. But I'm just trying out new techniques. There's Live Server for VS Code, a handy kitchen gadget. But if you don't use VS Code, you simply don't have access to it.

## Gathering Your Ingredients

Simply procure the 2 key ingredients (files) and place them in your project's pantry. If you wish, you can adjust the seasoning in the recipe file somewhere near the top of the file.

## Serving Instructions

Just open your console or shell, your command-line kitchen, and use `python3 webchef.py`.

After that, head to `127.0.0.1:8000` on your browser of choice, on the same device where your kitchen is set up.
