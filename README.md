## About The Project
There are some simple web servers for just testing when creating websites with HTML and CSS. But I had the feeling that they weren't so user friendly like this one. So I fixed it and tested something called: vibe-coding.

Of course, this one isn't the best. But I'm just trying. There is Live Server for VS Code. But if you don't use VS Code, you simply don't have it.


## Getting Started
Simply just copy the 3 files and paste them into the folder of your project. If you want you can change some things in the webchef.config file.

## Usage
Just open a console or shell and use `python3 webchef.py`.

After that go to 127.0.0.1:8000 on your browser of your choice on the same device.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation (soon)](#)_
